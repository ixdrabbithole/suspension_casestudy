        <h2>Narrative Development</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p> Inspired by the themes discussed in the greek folklore "Allegory of the Cave" we created an interactive transmedia project that our users can digitally interact with. It uses an indexical style of storytelling in the form of chapters that the user levels through. The narrative is primarily hosted on a website that also transpires over various digital platforms such as Instagram, Discord, etc, and integrates digital artifacts (AR, VR, Twine) to construct a truly interactive experience. The playable environment embodies a dark aesthetic with muted colors to accompany the seriousness of our plot. We make use of Cinema4d, three.js, and Web.GL to depict the environment in the form of a White Museum. This museum consists of paintings that function as segues into the linear chapters that our narrative consists of. Alongside these are digital artifacts positioned to support the core plot points of these chapters. Thus, the user plays out our narrative by interacting with these paintings + artifacts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our narrative uses redemption as a way to make our users question their morals and values. The choices that the user makes near the end of our narrative would be the prime example of this instance. Our goal here was to leave the user with thoughts and questions that they could entertain in their own life. This narrative also includes plots and materials that address topics such as substance abuse and assault, which might be triggering for certain audiences. Thus we advise our users to proceed with caution.

                <h3 style="text-align:left; margin-top: 0px;">What inspired our story?</h3>
                <p>Before conceptualizing a plot, our team was provided with a list of common greek folklores such as the Fall of Icarus, Pandora’s box, and Allegory of the Cave to structure a new narrative. After examining these tales we found that Allegory of the Cave acted as an excellent base to work from as it canvassed compelling topics such as <b>human perception, deception </b>and<b> truth finding.</b> For making a new transmedia narrative the chosen story was further broken down into core elements that gave allegory of the cave its edge. Specific elements of the story such as <b>‘unawareness of the truth’, ‘living within our own perceptions’ </b> and <b> ‘denial of new knowledge’</b> were stitched into our new narrative. Thus keeping in mind the nuances of Allegory of the cave, the team proposed a new modern narrative revolving around the transformation in perception of the protaginist from <b>unawareness to awareness.</b> </p>

              Suspension challenges the cycle between life and death. The catalyst that tributes to the beginning of our story comes from a terrible accident, which pulls the protagonist into a limbo to relive their past actions that led up to the tragedy. 

The story opens up with “The White Museum,” which displays artifacts of regret from the protagonist’s past, only playable once the artifact is unlocked through chapters. The chapters act as gateways, routes that the protagonist must take to experience the story in the form of a digital, physical, or AR artifact.

               <i>Suspension</i> draws on the relationship between three major characters who intersect, interweave, and incite events throughout the story. 
<br>
Our protagonist is an anti-hero who cares more about themselves than others with the exception of their little brother, the complete opposite of our protagonist and the only figure in the story whom the protagonist shows affection for. Death, otherwise known as the Grim Reaper, carries the burden of a severance that will affect the relationship between the protagonist and their little brother. 

                The three main characters severely impact the timeline of each other and the way the story is engaged.

                Their upbringing and relationship with their parents are negative, but instead of growing out of the trauma, the antihero continues to blame them for the root of all their mistakes and avoids the responsibility to be held accountable.

                They are referred to as genderless throughout the story for inclusivity, and to encompass the notion that a selfish person can be anyone.

                Their little brother is the opposite of our protagonist--a kind, sensitive, and optimistic symbol of innocence despite the gloomy family tribulations.

            <div class="column">
                <h4 id="columnHeader" style="color: #000000; float:left; ">Narrative Arc</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="columnOne">
               <p>
                <i>Suspension</i> will employ indexical storytelling to capture the backstory of our characters and main protagonist, the antihero. Throughout the story, the player is encouraged to interact with their phones to be a part of Death/Grim Reaper’s narrative who is steadily following the player up until they emerge in the last chapter.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Prologue</h4>

<p>Using the metaphor of a bright light that flashes before your eyes or the memories at the moment before your death, we are setting our theme of entering limbo. The narrative starts from the prologue where they enter <i>The White Museum</i> which displays an array of objects and paintings, all representing a regret or mistake of the protagonist’s past with an interactive feature. For example, we will have a family portrait with a dog to signify the lack of presence of the dog in the photo which will leave behind suggestions that the dog is no longer a part of the family. </p>
<br><br>
<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
<p>The story unfolds in high school where the culture of the world will be introduced. The main conflict in chapter 1 is the event where the protagonist outs their best friend--the first regret that the player interacts with. The former version of the protagonist realizes they may not be a great person because they lost their best friend but makes no move to fix it.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
<p>Here, we are involved with the family history and relationships between the protagonist and their family. The player is introduced to the little brother who is the only character that is shown affectionate from the protagonist. Chapter 2 plants the seeds of blame on the parents of this dysfunctional family for every mistake that the protagonist may ever have.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Chapter 3</h4>
<p>The main conflict in this chapter takes place at a house party during high school. The protagonist is a witness to an assault but does not do anything about it. During this time, they also begin to experiment with substances. There will be a scene of juxtaposition where the protagonist is seen blaming their problems to their family — a flashback to them seeing their parents drinking heavily as a child which parallels the current scene of doing nothing to stop the assault.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Chapter 4</h4>
<p>In the aftermath of the assault, the protagonist is shown to do nothing about it. The school environment is buzzing with background noise to highlight the previous event during the party. The protagonist is shown to have no remorse. This behaviour is juxtaposed to a scene of them catching their little brother experimenting with drugs--the same drugs that the protagonist messed around with in their room.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Chapter 5</h4>
<p>In chapter 5, it is the protagonist’s little brother’s birthday. But, with what could be a possible conviction, tying all loose ends from chapter 3, the consequences of the protagonist’s actions emerge. The victim of the assault approaches them with the law which results in the protagonist drinking their recent event away without taking responsibility. When the protagonist goes to pick up their little brother to go celebrate his birthday at a nearby restaurant, they end up fighting out of the little brother’s concern for the protagonist. But due to the protagonist’s DUI, the car swerves out of control and they crash. The little brother did not make it.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Chapter 6</h4>
<p>Death finally emerges from the shadows to approach our protagonist. The player has a conversation with them and are presented with two choices: be selfless and sacrifice your life to revive your brother, or live with regret.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="columnOne">
                <p>To begin this narrative experience, a ‘rabbit hole’ is needed to effectively enter the alternate reality of regrets. Optimally, this rabbit hole would be created through a series of posters that users would be able to view, and let their curiosity choose whether they delve into the alternate world. However, due to the limitations in place because of the pandemic, it is essential that the execution of the rabbit hole is set onto a digital platform, for safety measures, and to reach a wider audience.</p><br>
                <p> The rabbit hole will take place on Instagram, on an account dedicated for this narrative. The account will be mysterious and somewhat foreboding, having only it’s name, a link in the biography, and a single post. This post will include the subject matter of a ticket, enticing the user to “visit the White Museum”; it does not give any further information, other than the invitation via the link in the account’s bio. Users will be faced with the choice to enter the world and visit the White Museum, not knowing what is in store for them, or simply turn away from the account and pretend they didn’t see anything.</p><br>
                <p>As the main platform for inviting users to play will be Instagram, the promotion features could be utilized to promote the invitation post, and ideally reach a larger target audience. The account and post may also be shared among regular Instagram users

               <p> <i>Suspension</i> has a minimum of 8 digital artifacts, 1 physical artifact, and 1 AR component. 
<br> <br></p>
                <p>
                1) Our primary artifact is stationed in prologue: the <i>White Museum</i> is a WebGL + 3D environment incorporating three.js. It will employ the WASD keyboard movement controls which enables the player to interact and discover with their space. 
<br> <br></p><p>
                <i>The White Museum</i> will also host a variety of 3D models representing the regrets and mistakes of our protagonist, which showcases the backstory of our character once its interactions are made playable.The space is used to connect the different artifacts in our story. 
<br> <br></p><p>
2) In chapter 1, we will be using the medium of a webtoon to set the world and introduce characters, its ambience, and the culture. 
<br></p>
                <br>

<p>In chapter 2, our artifact is a Discord server that merges the world between our protagonist and their little brother, illustrating the backstory between them through conversations and pinned messages. </p>
<br>
                <br>

<p>In chapter 3, our artifact comes in the form of multiple Instagram accounts to show different angles of what happened within the chapter.</p> 
<br> <br>
<p>In chapter 4, our (physical through a digital means) artifact is a newspaper that is accompanied with a QR code showing the aftermath of chapter 3 and the gossip that surrounds the event featured by the high school newspaper club that our protagonist resides.</p>
<br> <br>
	<p>At this point in time, once the player reaches this chapter, two artifacts in The White Museum activate as an interactable medium featuring dialogue: a drug kit and a voicemail connected to a 3D model of a telephone booth to lead the player into chapter 5.</p>
<br> <br>
<p>In chapter 5, our artifact will be a podcast to illustrate the impact of a car crash to set the tone and ambience for the mood of that chapter. </p>
<br> <br>
<p>In chapter 6, our artifact will be twine to set the choice-based endings with an if condition and we will also be creating mini animations per ending.</p>
<br> <br>
<b>Bonus:</b>
<br> <br>
<p>Our overarching narrative will have sound effects such as the background noise of chatter in a high school setting to enhance the story. </p>
<br> <br>
<p>We will also have an AR artifact to signify Death through the use of people’s phones. When the player is encouraged to use their phones, the sentient being in the corner of their room is placed precariously for shock value to instill fear and a feeling of strangeness.

                <p>The narrative experience is shaped towards a demographic of young adults, roughly ranging from ages 18 - 30 years old. This audience includes college and university students, particularly those in North America, whose interests include, but are not limited to: video games, reading and storytelling, social media, and cinematography. The narrative experience uses a gender and race neutral protagonist, thus leaving an open interpretation for the player, allowing them to fully assimilate themselves into the main role.

        <h2>Reflections and Next Steps</h2>

        <p> We made multiple iterations of our plot which condensed the narrative to its playable experience. After planning out the didgital artifacts we gained a clearer idea of how we wanted this narrative experince to progress. We also realised that intead of a branching narrative we wanted an indexical narrative with one branching instance near the end of the narrative which decides how this experience ends. This choice is made by the user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Currently we are looking for methods that can help simplify our processes. Since our narrative also incorporates Twine and Webtoons. We are currently in a period of testing these softwares. Regarding the actualy environment building, we aim to incorporate 3D moddelling and coding that we learned in our previous courses.
