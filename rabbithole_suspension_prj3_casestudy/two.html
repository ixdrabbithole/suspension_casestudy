        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <p> Have you ever wondered what happens after you die? Would you think about the things you could have fixed or just pass on?
                Suspension is an interactive story about being stuck in limbo with no way out but to face your regrets. You decide the end.

            <h3>WHAT IS SUSPENSION?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Suspension is an interactive narrative project that transpires over multiple media platforms such as Discord, Instagram, Twine, and AR to stage out the plot of ‘Suspension’. Here, different media platforms are used as ‘artifacts’ to portray the different chapters that make up this interactive experience. The user “plays” out these chapters by interacting with objects placed within the “white museum”. The white museum 3D AR environment acts as the home base of suspension.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The plot of suspension revolves around the anti-hero “Blu”. Through this narrative, users witness their history, behaviors, actions, all the things that make them a pariah. But, it is also a story about redemption, albeit not in a way one expects. Ultimately, the user has left choices they must make based on their views, morals, and strategy. The user decides how Suspension ends.

        <div class="row">

            <p style="text-align: center;"> Suspension draws on the relationship between three major characters who intersect, interweave, and incite events throughout the story.Our protagonist <i>"Blu"</i> is an anti-hero who cares more about themselves than others with the exception of their little brother <i>"Finch"</i>, the complete opposite of our protagonist and the only figure in the story whom the protagonist shows affection for. Ultimately, when <i>"Death"</i> comes knocking Blu is forced to acknowledge the reason why the looming presence that has been following them in then White Museum.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The previous plot of suspension explored darker topics such as sexual, family, and drug abuse. A lot of discrepancies were noticed during script building as it was hard to make the plot less triggering. Initially, Blu was sketched out by a drug addict who kills his brother and friends under the influence. They were also someone who witnessed sexual abuse but didn’t do anything about it as it did not concern them. The climax of the plot then revolved around Blu’s insufficiency to confess to the police about the sexual abuse, them getting caught, and going on the lam to avoid prosecution. Considering these story elements, a lot of them were initially far-fetched and simply jotted down for user shock. Alas, during hashing out the plot details, gaps were noticed not only within the storyline but also user interactivity and the flow + functionality of the digital artifact. Thus, the team decided to conduct user testing to verify and eliminate unnecessary elements.

                <p>
                    <br>
                    After going through several rounds of user testing some of the core points that came up during testing could be summerised into:
                    <br><br>
                    <li>A lengthy plot that could do without the extra details.</li>
                    <li>Complicated storytelling that will confuse the users.</li>
                    <li>Discrepancies in the plot details that do not alight with real-life experiences and events.</li>
                    <li>Jagged Flow of events and artifacts that will confuse the user.</li>
                    <li>Plot is too dark for general audiences and might put off some younger audiences.</li>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Though this round of user testing did not fully address the issues within the user interactivity these tips helped eliminate most of the issues that were faced up till then.

        <br>
        <p> This artifact is the 3D white museum that the user essentially functions within. During the developmental stage, two different layouts of the white museum were tested out to offer a better visual experience. These models were created using Cinema 4D and coded using A-frame. The White Museum uses minimal colors for distinguishing features. As for A-frame some of the primary feathers that are being currently tested out are the Navigations Meshes and user-based object interactions. We are currently trying to establish improved methods within A-frame for smooth transitions between chapters.</p>

        <p> A Discord server was created to show the dynamic between Blu and Finch’s relationship and their relationship with their family through their exchanged dialogue. Discord is used as the main digital platform depicting Chapter 2. It is should also be noted that the siblings use discord as their primary source of communication as it is completely data-free and they can incorporate a lot more of their daily life within this online world. This dialogue was created using discord bots. The server also includes asset made by the team to establish the social relationships between the sibling:</p>

        <h4>4. Digital Artifact - Spotify</h4>
        <p> Within the aforementioned Discord server, a Spotify playlist was integrated to build on Finch and Blu’s world. Since music plays a large role in showcasing a person’s personality through its lyrics and musical style, the intention to add Spotify was to build layers to the characters in this story. The use of a Spotify playlist also establishes “relatable” content so as to increase user investment and worldbuilding. This playlist can be checked out in the discord server or here:</p>

        <h2>Upcoming Artifacts:</h2>

        <h4>1. Digital Artifact - Instagram</h4>
        <p> The first quarter of chapter 3 is told through finches Instagram stories. The events will be shown through animations in Finch's Instagram story. This would be an actual Instagram account under Finch’s name. The team is currently in the process of planning out digital assets for Finch's posts. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>2. Digital Artifact - Audio</h4>
        <p> The middle portion of chapter 3 is exclusively told through audio-only. The audio was chosen as the primary platform for this so as to avoid visual instances of sensitive material. For this artifact, we are currently working on a script and casting our peers for voicing Finch and Blu. The team has explored sounds banks such as Epidemic Sounds and Zaps Splat for royalty-free sound effects. These sounds effects will be combined using Adobe Audition. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>3. Digital Artifact - Digital police Case Files</h4>
        <p> This artifact will be made up of artificial 2 police case files with visual assets that will showcase two core events that make up chapter 3 (hit and run and the final accident). These assets will be made to resemble police evidence and the files will, essentially, be a collage of these "evidence" assests. These case files will be posted onto a separate link resembling a police website. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>4. Digital Artifact - Twine</h4>
        <p> Chapter 4 offers the user choices-based argument. This chapter also involves a script that takes place between Blu and the Grim Reaper. Here two choices are witnessed: where the users can either save their brother or themselves. Each choice also entails a small animation showcasing the aftermath of their choices. When the user chooses to save Blu they experience the guilt and pain Blu lives out with and when the user chooses to save Finch they see Finch growing and learning from the mistakes of their brother.

        <h2>Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <h4> Primary Physical Artifact : Zappar AR</h4>

        <p>
            Zappar AR is used as the primary rabbit hole for this Suspension. A physical poster depicting a text from the White Museum accompanied by a scannable QR code shows the user two states of mind— one of regret and one of pure apathy. Once the user scans the marker the artifact encourages them to “Go to the White Museum”. This “coded” strategy was employed to show the duality of mind as well as create an enhanced interactive poster that will surely trick the people to visit the white museum. Test out the rabbit hole poster here:</p>

        <h4>Secondary Physical Artifact : Instagram</h4>
        <p> Instagram is used as a secondary rabbit hole to promote Suspension's White Museum. The markeing strategy that is employed here is similar to that of an event promotion. It is ensured that stories and images about the 'white museum experience' are posted often at scheduled times to gather continuous traffic. These posts are often contain rhetorical question thats is intended to make the user wonder about the nature of the white museum, therefore it ensures increased user interest over time.

        <h2> Project Management</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Risks and Opportunities</h3>
        <p> Some events that the team looks forward to prepare for are coding challenges with development of main AR Platform, low user engagement and low feedback. Another obstacle would be ensuring the narrative is clear and seamless across each artifact platform. We intend to combat these potential bumps by practising better team communication and project management strategies in order to meet the deadlines. Furthermore, the team emphasizes detail-oriention to make each artifact clear and comprehensible to all audiences thus promoting the smooth and clean narrative experiences. In order to avoid these hurdels it is important to planning according the time given for the final submissions. To achive this, the team updated their project management documents to better suit the current course of schedule. Check out the Gnatt Chart here:
