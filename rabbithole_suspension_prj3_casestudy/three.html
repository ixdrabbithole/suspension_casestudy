        <h2>SUSPENSION</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <p> Have you ever wondered what happens after you die? Would you think about the things you could have fixed or just pass on?
                Suspension is an interactive story about being stuck in limbo with no way out but to face your regrets. You decide the end.

            <h3>WHAT IS SUSPENSION?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Suspension is an interactive narrative project that transpires over multiple media platforms such as Discord, Instagram, Twine, and AR to stage out the plot of ‘Suspension’. Here, different media platforms are used as ‘artifacts’ to portray the different chapters that make up this interactive experience. The user “plays” out these chapters by interacting with objects placed within the “white museum”. The white museum 3D AR environment acts as the home base of suspension.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The plot of suspension revolves around the anti-hero “Blu”. Through this narrative, users witness their history, behaviors, actions, all the things that make them a pariah. But, it is also a story about redemption, albeit not in a way one expects. Ultimately, the user has left choices they must make based on their views, morals, and strategy. The user decides how Suspension ends.

        <h2>Meet the Characters</h2>
        <br>

        <p style="text-align: center;"> Suspension draws on the relationship between three major characters who intersect, interweave, and incite events throughout the story.Our protagonist <i>"Blu"</i> is an anti-hero who cares more about themselves than others with the exception of their little brother <i>"Finch"</i>, the complete opposite of our protagonist and the only figure in the story whom the protagonist shows affection for. Ultimately, when <i>"Death"</i> comes knocking Blu is forced to acknowledge the reason why the looming presence that has been following them in then White Museum.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The previous plot of suspension explored darker topics such as sexual, family, and drug abuse. A lot of discrepancies were noticed during script building as it was hard to make the plot less triggering. Initially, Blu was sketched out by a drug addict who kills his brother and friends under the influence. They were also someone who witnessed sexual abuse but didn’t do anything about it as it did not concern them. The climax of the plot then revolved around Blu’s insufficiency to confess to the police about the sexual abuse, them getting caught, and going on the lam to avoid prosecution. Considering these story elements, a lot of them were initially far-fetched and simply jotted down for user shock. Alas, during hashing out the plot details, gaps were noticed not only within the storyline but also user interactivity and the flow + functionality of the digital artifact. Thus, the team decided to conduct user testing to verify and eliminate unnecessary elements.

                <p>
                    <br>
                    After going through several rounds of user testing some of the core points that came up during testing could be summerised into:
                    <br><br>
                    <li>A lengthy plot that could do without the extra details.</li>
                    <li>Complicated storytelling that will confuse the users.</li>
                    <li>Discrepancies in the plot details that do not alight with real-life experiences and events.</li>
                    <li>Jagged Flow of events and artifacts that will confuse the user.</li>
                    <li>Plot is too dark for general audiences and might put off some younger audiences.</li>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Though this round of user testing did not fully address the issues within the user interactivity these tips helped eliminate most of the issues that were faced up till then.

                Zappar AR is used as the primary rabbit hole for this Suspension. A physical poster depicting a text from the White Museum accompanied by a scannable QR code shows the user two states of mind— one of regret and one of pure apathy. Once the user scans the marker the artifact encourages them to “Go to the White Museum”. This “coded” strategy was employed to show the duality of mind as well as create an enhanced interactive poster that will surely trick the people to visit the white museum. Test out the rabbit hole poster here:</p>

            <h4>Secondary Physical Artifact : Instagram</h4>
            <p> Instagram is used as a secondary rabbit hole to promote Suspension's White Museum. The markeing strategy that is employed here is similar to that of an event promotion. It is ensured that stories and images about the 'white museum experience' are posted often at scheduled times to gather continuous traffic. These posts are often contain rhetorical question thats is intended to make the user wonder about the nature of the white museum, therefore it ensures increased user interest over time.

            <h3>VR Artifact - White Museum</h3>
            <br>
            <p> This artifact is the 3D white museum that the user essentially functions within. During the developmental stage, two different layouts of the white museum were tested out to offer a better visual experience. These models were created using Cinema 4D and coded using A-frame. The White Museum uses minimal colors for distinguishing features. As for A-frame some of the primary feathers that are being currently tested out are the Navigations Meshes and user-based object interactions. We are currently trying to establish improved methods within A-frame for smooth transitions between chapters.</p>

            <p> A Discord server was created to show the dynamic between Blu and Finch’s relationship and their relationship with their family through their exchanged dialogue. Discord is used as the main digital platform depicting Chapter 2. It is should also be noted that the siblings use discord as their primary source of communication as it is completely data-free and they can incorporate a lot more of their daily life within this online world. This dialogue was created using discord bots. The server also includes asset made by the team to establish the social relationships between the sibling:</p>

            <p> Within the aforementioned Discord server, a Spotify playlist was integrated to build on Finch and Blu’s world. Since music plays a large role in showcasing a person’s personality through its lyrics and musical style, the intention to add Spotify was to build layers to the characters in this story. The use of a Spotify playlist also establishes “relatable” content so as to increase user investment and worldbuilding. This playlist can be checked out in the discord server or here:</p>

            <h3>Chapter 3. Digital Artifact - Police Case File: Newspaper clipping + Audio File</h3>
            <p> The police case file narrates the events of Chapter 3 through the means of a pdf. The PDF is a combination of news reports, evidence articles (snippets from discord + audio file), an official accident report and a 911 transcript made to the police. Each page in the police file gives a detailed description of the events leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Within the Police Case file is a ‘black box’ recording of the events that transpired on the day of the accident. The audio gives the listener detailed imagery of the entire day, from the moment Blu and Finch plan to meet, find themselves in troubles, to their final moments together.

            <h3>Chapter 4. Digital Artifact - Twine</h3>
            <p> In the final chapter Twine is used to break the 4th wall and speak to the player so that they can "play" vicariously through the perspective of Blu. This interaction forges a connection between our anti-hero and the player. It also reinforces the idea that Blu is on their arc of redemption, making them more vulnerable and human in the player’s eyes. Ultimately, the user is offered two options that decide the ending of Suspension. There are no right or wrong endings here and each option leads to a future event involving the chosen option.

        <h2> Closing thoughts</h2>

        <br>
        <p> Over the course of this project the team went through multiple rounds of plot and game play interations. After each round we gained more and more insight of what aesthetically worked with the plot and what disrupted the experince in the form of plotholes, media choice, script details etc. We learned that while working on a project we may get desensitized to some of the plotholes and shortcomings in our projects or even our biases might interrupt the user experience. Through this project not only did we gain insignt in to how work better in team settings but also figure out ways to reach common ground where in every one is pleased with the final delivery. We learned how to improve our narrative/ story thinking and accurate transmedia integration. We're grateful for this experince and look forward to apply some of the lessons learned in out future project. Thank you so much for reading. We hope you enjoyed Suspension.</p>
